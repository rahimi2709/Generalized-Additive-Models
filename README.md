# Generalized-Additive-Models
Generalized Additive Models or GAM is an applicable method which provides more flexibility in specifying the covariate dependency of the response and It's simple to understand. Also, predictor functions with a wide range of options can reveal hidden patterns in data and overfitting can be reduced by regularising prediction functions. In this project, Generalized Additive Models(GAM) has been used to undertake an investigation of tuberculosis (TB) data coming from Brazil. Brazil is splitted into 557 administrative microregions, and the data supplied includes the number of TB cases in each microregion from 2012 to 2014.
